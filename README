As the name implies this rotator is not for those needing a massive amount of functionality.
This script does one thing, rotates 4 images, with user supplied easing and duration.

Example usage:
All that is needed to use this script is an image in a div with the appropriate css.
From there simply include the script and call the function with the easing and duration
of your choice. Please note this script REQUIRES both jQuery (for selection) 
and jQueryUI (for easing effects).

HTML:
<div id="rotator">
	<img src="your-very-wide-sprite.jpg" width="3416" height="362" alt="">
</div>

CSS:
#rotator {
    width:854px;
    overflow:hidden;
}

#rotator img {
    margin-left:0px;
}

Note that the margin-left rule is NECCESARY for the function to work, do not forget it!

javaScript:
$('#rotator').rotator('jswing', 'easeInOutCirc', 2000, 500, 7500, 3416);


That's it!
